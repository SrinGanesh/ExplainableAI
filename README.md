This repository demonstrates the use of SHAP and LIME frameworks

SHAP and LIME Frameworks Demonstration
This repository contains code examples and demonstrations of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) frameworks. These tools are used for interpreting and understanding machine learning model predictions.

Contents:
SHAP Framework:
Introduction to SHAP
Implementation of SHAP for various models
Visualizations of SHAP values
Case studies and example datasets
LIME Framework:
Introduction to LIME
Implementation of LIME for different models
Visualizations of LIME explanations
Case studies and example datasets
Key Features:
Model Interpretability: Understand how individual features contribute to model predictions.
Interactive Visualizations: Generate visualizations that make it easy to explain model behavior.
Comprehensive Examples: Step-by-step implementations for various machine learning models.
Practical Applications: Real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the use of SHAP and LIME.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Explore the Jupyter notebooks for SHAP and LIME demonstrations.
This repository is intended for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and anyone interested in model interpretability. It provides practical insights and tools to make machine learning models more transparent and understandable.
